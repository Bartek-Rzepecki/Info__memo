# Info.memo()

This is a website that will help you study! Created in React with CRA, database and hosting from Firebase.

Styling is made with Sass and CSS Modules.

Feel free to clone this repository and change as you wish.

Since it is not a commercial project I used pictures from Unslpash.com

Here is the list of appopriate authors:

1. Instagram - @andrewtneel | Donations - paypal.me/AndrewNeel
